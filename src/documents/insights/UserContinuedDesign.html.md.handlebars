It is not practical for a designer to meet the needs of every user and include every desired feature within a single product or service, nor to predict the infinite variety of creative, serendipitous, and unexpected uses that a product or service can be subjected to. A goal of inclusive design is to extend the design process into the designed artifact itself, to give users the ability to continue the design process themselves after the the product has “shipped”, in order to adapt the design to better meet their needs.

For example, imagine that a learner has the ability to adapt the appearance of a learning resource to be easier to see and simpler. They also have the ability to share this adapted version with others. Useful adaptations and variations become opportunities for creating communities of interconnected learners who support each other. This means that learners, too, are provided with the means to construct, derive and share their own learning materials, to be their own teachers and curriculum creators while engaging with the materials provided to them. In this way the ability to create content is not solely reserved for their teachers and experts, hidden behind "authoring" or "administrative" modes.

For users, design can become a process of undoing, extending, or changing the design to suit themselves; to better match their environment, needs, preferences, personal tastes, and creative imperatives. In this way, inclusive design sustains the design process by encouraging user stewardship through actively supporting its own unexpected, creative, and ongoing redesign by users.
