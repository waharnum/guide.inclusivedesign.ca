Discover the chain of events that gets you from a cause to a final effect.

This activity demonstrates the potential to have a **broader beneficial impact with our everyday actions**. It utilizes the [Cause and Effect card deck](/images/CauseAndEffectCards.pdf) (downloadable pdf).

The causes contained in the deck represent everyday things that participants may be doing; they are small tasks such as:


* share meeting minutes in a form that your colleague using a screen reader can access,
* add sound feedback to a button in your UX design,
* coach employee in managing a pension,
* order real time captioning for meeting.

The effects are as far away from the causes as possible. They might include:

* grandmother in Ecuador connects with children in LA,
* Polar bear is saved from ice flow in Alaska,
* etc.

These should be as specific and diverse as possible.

## Step 1
Choose a random card from the Cause deck, then do the same from the Effect deck. Or describe your own cause and effect.

## Step 2
Define a chain of effects that takes you all the way from the initial cause to the final effect. Record each effect and map out the chain of effects - allowing branching or multiple paths where they emerge.
