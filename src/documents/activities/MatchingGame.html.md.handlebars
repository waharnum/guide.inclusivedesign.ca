Choose a persona, context and goal from the list. Feel free to add any information that might help to
describe the situation in more detail.
Choose an appropriate product or service from the
list that will help your persona accomplish their goal
in the given context.

Frame your personaâ€™s goal into a list of needs by
considering the step-by-step process they might take
in accomplishing their goal. Where possible, match
these needs up with the features associated with
your product or service.

Decide whether or not your persona was able to
accomplish their goal using the product or service
you have selected. Were their needs met at each
step? If not, consider how you might redesign this
product or service in a way that would allow them to
succeed, keeping in mind the insights, practices
and tools of inclusive design.
